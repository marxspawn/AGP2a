AGP2a - Final Project

### This is group project, all team members must work together and create a single program.
  - Only one team member will need to upload a copy to blackboard.
## Instructions:

#### 1.	Design and implement a Java system based on the following criteria and information:

  *	Must track multiple kinds of objects, for example:

     * People, e.g., customers, employees, students, instructors, etc.

  *	Products including IDs, descriptions, inventory, etc.

  * Courses, etc.

  * Services, etc.

  * Must follow a three-tier application model or software architecture, i.e., consist of the following three layers:

    * User Interface, which must be accomplished using JavaFX, i.e., all information gathered from the user or displayed to the user must be done via JavaFX panes, etc.

    *	Business logic, which consist of objects, lists, etc. where the data is temporarily multipulated in RAM and separates the user interface from the database

    *	Database, where the data is permanently stored

  *	Must use polymorphism, e.g., a list of different types of people

  *	Must implement CRUD, that is:

    *	Create, i.e., add new data, e.g., via an object/record to a list

    *	Retrieve, i.e., retrieve and display information from a record

    * Update, i.e., change an existing record

    * Delete, i.e., appropriately remove a record from a list; keep in mind, you may need to archive the information or delete other related information to maintain integrity

  * Must demonstrate searching for and displaying one and many records, and sorting the data appropriately

  *	See the attached System Application.pdf for an example of a system you could create; please note: the attached is incomplete concerning this project, but your team could use it as a starting point

  * Make sure you write up and discuss your project with the professor ASAP, so you will have plenty of time to complete it before the end of the semester



#### 2. Thoroughly test your system using a variety of data and on different systems.   

- Your system should work whether data exist in the database or not;

  - In other words, the system should be able to create the initial database if one does not already exist, and then, go from there.

#### 3.	Export your entire project via Eclipse including the database.

  - At this point, you should test it by importing it into Eclipse via a different system.

    - Create instructions for accomplishing this;

    - In other words, when the professor imports your project at home, there should be no issues.

#### 4.	Zip up everything into a single ZIP file.

#### 5.	Have only one member of your team submit the ZIP file via this assignment.

#### 6.	Verify your submission.

#### 7.	Complete AGP2b - Final Project individually, i.e., each person must submit a completed Group Evaluation form.

#### 8.	Prepare to demonstrate your application during class.
